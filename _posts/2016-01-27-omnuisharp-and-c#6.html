I worked with the guy that wrote Omnisharp and have been using it a lot at work to save having 3/4 instance of VS2015 open.
</p>

<p>
Problem work just started usign all the new fancy C#6 stuff like string interpolation.
This stuff needs to use the new MSBuild, for me at  <code>C:/Program Files (x86)/MSBuild/14.0/Bin/</code>
</p>


<p>
It's easy enough to see that <a href="https://github.com/OmniSharp/omnisharp-server/blob/e1902915c6790bcec00b8d551199c8a3537d33c9/OmniSharp/Build/BuildCommandBuilder.cs#L31">omnisharp has a config value for this</a>.
</p>

<p>
<b>Setting it in the config.json</b> found in the omnisharp server is easy enough.
</p>

<p>
Problem is windows emacs will shit the bed trying to parse the spaces.
Normally you can just quote it or escape it, meh.
</p>

<p>
Getting that past omnisharp config parser &amp; command builder and then get the command to run successfully in emacs.
</p>

<p>
Meh,
#+NAME Config setting to use the new MSBuild with spaces in address
