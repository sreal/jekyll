I picked my scrum master certification recently.

Jimmy started out doing a job. He did it for a while.
</p>

<p>
Slowly Jimmy figured out how to improve it.
Jimmy could have done it faster, he could had done it better in the same time.
But best of all Jimmy worked out way to not do it at all.
</p>

<p>
He thought to himself, 'Geez, I was doing that like a sucker, no more doing that the sucker way for me'.

Jimmy is your dev team.
Getting better is Jimmy's fault.
</p>

<p>
Stop your dev team doing stuff like suckers.
