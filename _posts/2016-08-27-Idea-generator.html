<p>
Building a game idea generator is pretty much a right of passage for anyone how likes building games.
</p>

<p>
Eveyone should do it and not because you can't come up with ideas.
</p>

<p>
It's because what you you're really working on your definition of what a game really is.
</p>



<p>
Reducing the abstract idea of a game down to something tangile will put a lot of interesting thoughts about the concepts into
down to just name,actions,things,goals
