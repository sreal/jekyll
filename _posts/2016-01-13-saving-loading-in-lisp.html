title: Saving and loading data in emacs lisp

<div id="outline-container-sec-1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="sec-1">Now loading&#x2026; please wait.</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-1">
<p>
As a primer in lisp I had did a few of the <a href="http://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> problem last year. They all required reading from an input.
Much like load my level as part of step for in Building a Roguelike.
</p>

<p>
Code is pretty simple..
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-sec-1-1" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-1">Reading from a file.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-1">
<p>
The code is simple and similar to every other language. This code will also split on each line lines.
I'm using the as the second parameter in a <code>mapcar</code>, so I can iterate over each character and add walls as needed.
</p>

<p>
#+NAME Read from a file into
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun sre/read-lines (filepath)
  "Return each line of file at FILEPATH and remove empty lines."
  (with-temp-buffer
    (insert-file-contents filepath)
    (remove-if 'null (split-string (buffer-string) "\n" t))))
</pre>
</div>


<p>
This turned out nice. The map file is an actual visible map.
</p>

<p>
#+NAME Map example
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-txt">#####
#.#.#
#...#
#####
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Would be nice to work out how to get <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ArtistMode">artist-mode</a> to draw different characters.
</p>


<p>
For the configuration/state stuff i'll just put straight up lists. There is a <code>eval</code> in emacs lisp that can just read it directly in.
</p>

<p>
#+NAME Parse lisp data/code from a file
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(defun rl/load-state (filepath)
  "Return the contents of FILEPATH as a lisp object."
  (let ((content (with-temp-buffer
		   (insert-file-contents filepath)
		   (buffer-string))))
    (read content)))
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-sec-1-2" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="sec-1-2">Reading to a file.</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-1-2">
<p>
Writing and object looks simple enough.
Just use the write-region with a format and path name.
</p>

<p>
#+NAME Write lisp object to file
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre class="src src-emacs-lisp">(write-region (format "%s" state) nil filepath)
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
