Our lives are just a bunch of stories we've told ourselves so we can function 'normally'.
These stories could be 'wrong'.
</p>


<p>
If you've told yourself the same story enough times,  it's hard to tell when the story stops and we start.
</p>


<p>
At that point, if someone tells you the story is 'wrong', it's no longer about changing how we think about something.
It's something 'wrong' about you.
</p>


<p>
If you're at the tail end, it makes sense that questioning one story becomes questioning all your stories.
</p>


<p>
That would be a tough.
