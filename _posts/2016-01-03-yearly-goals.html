I pick up a lot of agile practices at work this year.
While not a convert, there are some things that work.

The game james were fun, both technically and creatively.
</p>

<p>
Project 365 was guilt inducing at times.
Need to do more with captured images.
</p>

<p>
French has improved but requires the most concious practice.
</p>

<p>
Didn't do much reading, lots of podcasts.
The ones outside of tech had greatest ROI.
(A buck a show was best purchase, #hardcorehistroy)
</p>

<p>
Losing 20 pound was pretty fuck you I can do anything.
Definatley a different mindset afterwards.
Very different doing it with maintainable methods than body hacks.

Time to be a bit more active.
</p>

<p>
P365 feels goo having records of works.
This journal/blog is an extension of that.
A post a month(ish) feels doable.
</p>

<p>
Shipping is rewarding.
#onegameamonth could be tough, do feels doable.
Jam post-mortems are good low hanging fruit for here.
Possible just a tech build a month.
</p>

<p>
More reading this year.
Trello's a good bucket, not for data.
Papers &amp; browsables gtd next actions moved from trello to org-mode might make them more visible.
Still unsure if this is a good idea, will see after a while.
</p>

<p>
Fitness stuff will continue, going to start including weights.
</p>

<p>
Other minor stuff I'm not sure about yet include:
pick up a lisp (maybe vim/evil),
art/drawing/painting (the game jame art was tough).
