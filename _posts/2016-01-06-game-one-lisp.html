I use emacs but never spent time in lisp except my configs. Time to change that.
Found a 12 step here's how to build a roguelike <a href="http://www.roguebasin.com/index.php?title=How_to_Write_a_Roguelike_in_15_Steps&oldid=39275">here on roguebasin</a>
</p>


<p>
I'm thinking the 12 steps will provide enough of a guideline for direction instead of just dropping in and flaining.

There's also a lisp game jam on right now, it's to late to make the weekend deadline but motivation never hurt.
Get something out for the end of the month is more reasonable.

Still unsure which lisp. It's between emacs lisp and common lisp.
Putting the finish product puts into <a href="http://melpa.org/">http://melpa.org/</a> or <a href="https://marmalade-repo.org/">https://marmalade-repo.org/</a> is pretty fancy.
