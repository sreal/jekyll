After entering Ludum Dare 35 (<a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=62549">play it here</a>), I'm looking forward to my May edition of #1GAM.

<p>
I'm thinking a straight up clone of Pitfall!.
With a set feature list a lots of the decisions are already made but it should have some interesting thinks.
</p>

<p>
Pitfall at it's most basic is a bunch on looping rooms with the same above ground/beloew ground layout, and with different objects.
I was thinking about using tile editor to layout the rooms but realised it is only one scene with different objects per room.
</p>

<p>
I'm going to try a consultant scrum workflow, using a week as a sprint.
Honestly I think the inital scene is going to take less than a weekend.
I would like it to look ok and the end possible with custom assets.
