Ran a half marathon for the first time on the weekend.

Running around Circuit Gilles Villeneuve in Febuary is not warmest, but I did get to run around <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Circuit_Gilles_Villeneuve_Hairpin.jpg">the hairpin</a>.

Was good to see that piece of Montreal in the heart of winter because without a good reason, there is no reason for a sane person to be there.
