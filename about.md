### Hi, I'm Simon Eames.

I really enjoy building stuff and getting others to build interesting things. A lot of the time it's with computers.

This journal is so I don't need to remember how to do things. I can be lazy like that.

If any of it helps you, that's great and I'd enjoy hearing about it too :)
